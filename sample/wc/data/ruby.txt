Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, general purpose object-oriented programming 
language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features. 
Ruby originated in Japan during the mid-1990s and was initially developed and 
designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto.
Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object 
oriented, imperative and reflection. It also has a dynamic type system and 
automatic memory management; it is therefore similar in varying respects to 
Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU.
The standard 1.8.6 (stable) implementation is written in C, as a single-pass 
interpreted language. There is currently no specification of the Ruby language, 
so the original implementation is considered to be the de facto reference. As of 
2008, there are a number of complete or upcoming alternative implementations of 
the Ruby language, including YARV, JRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby, and MacRuby, each 
of which takes a different approach, with JRuby and IronRuby providing 
just-in-time compilation functionality. The official 1.9 (development) branch 
uses YARV, and so will 2.0, and will eventually supersede the slower Ruby MRI.

[edit] History
 
Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby.Ruby was conceived on February 24, 1993 
by Yukihiro Matsumoto who wished to create a new language that balanced 
functional programming with imperative programming.[1] According to Matsumoto he 
"wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more 
object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language".[2]
[edit] Etymology of the name "Ruby"
The name "Ruby" was decided on during an online chat session between Matsumoto 
and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for 
the language.[3] Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby", with the 
latter the one being chosen as the name by Matsumoto in a later email to 
Ishitsuka.[4] Matsumoto has later stated that a factor in choosing the name 
"Ruby" was because it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.[5] Later it 
was recognized that pearl is the birthstone for the month of June, while ruby is 
the birthstone for July, implying Ruby as the successor of Perl.[6][7]
[edit] First publication
The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic 
newsgroups on December 21, 1995.[8][9] Subsequently three more versions of Ruby 
were released in two days.[10] The release coincided with the launch of the 
Japanese language ruby-list mailing list which was the first mailing list for 
the new language.
Already present at this stage of development were many of the features familiar 
in later releases of Ruby, including object oriented design, classes with 
inheritance, mixins, iterators, closures, exception handling, and garbage 
collection.[11]
[edit] Ruby 1.0
Ruby reached version 1.0 on December 25, 1996.[12]
Following the release of Ruby 1.3 in 1999 the first English language mailing 
list ruby-talk began,[13] which signaled a growing interest in the language 
outside of Japan. In September 2000, the first English language book Programming 
Ruby was printed, which was later freely released to the public further widening 
the adoption of Ruby amongst native English speakers.
[edit] Ruby 1.8.7
As of June 2008, the latest stable version of the reference implementation is 
1.8.7.
[edit] Philosophy
The language's creator, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, has said that Ruby is 
designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good 
user interface design.[14] He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize 
human, rather than computer, needs [15]:
